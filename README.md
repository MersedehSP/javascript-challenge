This homework has two levels:

### UFO Level 1: Automatic Table and Date Search 

* This code appends a table to a web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting.

  * there is a  column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment` 

* there is a date form in this HTML document, and the associated JavaScript code will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### UFO Level 2: Multiple Search Categories 

* using the index.html in this folder, you can search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  > 1. `date/time`
  > 2. `city`
  > 3. `state`
  > 4. `country`
  > 5. `shape`


So, in this level not only you are able to search for sightings based on date and time, but also you can search for any mix of the criteria.
